##  Harmony-Melody Encoded Song Utilities

Jupyter Notebook ingests data and trains Markov models for harmony tools. 

The "Harmonizer" will provide a chord to play for a given melody note and a prior Harmony-Melody pair. 

At the end of the notbook the models are used to generate a song, an A Part and a B Part.
